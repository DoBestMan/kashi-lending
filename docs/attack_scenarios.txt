By borrowing the assets can be put into:
Elastic 1, base 1000000
When adding assets, we add borrow converted to shares to get allShares and use that to calculate your fraction


Add asset 1 share - receive 1 fraction
Borrow 1 share - receive 1 amount
Wait - util 100% - accrue
Borrow amount = 2
Repay amount = 2
Assets = 2 share - 1 fraction
Add 1 share - receive 0 fraction
Add 2 share - receive 0 fraction
Add 3
Add 6
20 steps = 1000000


Borrow 10 amount = 1 part
Repay 1 part = 2 amount


Asset elastic = 1 - base = 1
Borrow - 1 elastic - base = 1000
1001 - 1001000
